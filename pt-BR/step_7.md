## Move the player sprite

The player sprite will animate to look like it is moving, but it will actually be the background that is moving, which you set up earlier.

\--- task ---

When the game starts, you want the player sprite to be at the front.

In the player sprite's Code tab, add a layer block when the flag is clicked:

```blocks3
+when flag clicked
+go to [front v] layer
```

\--- /task ---

To make the player sprite look like it's moving towards either side, use a direction block so that when the arrow keys are pressed, the player sprite appears to change direction.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
forever
if <key (left arrow v) pressed> then
+point in direction (130)
next costume
end
if <key (right arrow v) pressed> then
+point in direction (-130)
next costume
end
```

**Test your code!** Press the green flag and the player sprite should move when you use the left and right keys.

Your direction might be different — test out a few angles with the direction block until it looks like your sprite is facing the right way, as every sprite will be different depending on what the drawing looks like.

Now use an `operator`{:class="block3operators"} block to add the up and down keys. These don't need a direction, so the code is the same for both up and down.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
forever
if <key (left arrow v) pressed> then
point in direction (90)
next costume
end
if <key (right arrow v) pressed> then
point in direction (-90)
next costume
end
+if <<key (up arrow v) pressed> or <key (up arrow v) pressed >> then
next costume
end
```
